# Handwriting Recognition Application

Leveraged the MNIST dataset consisting of 70,000 hand-drawn letters to train a neural network with Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Numpy, and OpenCV with 98% accuracy 
Created a whiteboard application that processes and identifies new hand-drawn numbers using the trained model with Pygame
